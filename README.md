## Challenges and Learnings

### Fetching Data with Axios

One of the challenges I faced was fetching data from the API using Axios. I initially struggled with handling errors and parsing the response data correctly. After researching and troubleshooting, I learned how to properly configure Axios to handle errors and extract the required data from the response.
